            "I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. (We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I can’t quite think of an example of that at the moment) he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it, he tells me it’s wrong. Example, he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options, drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago, he said he needed photo ID for a test at work he’d been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we don’t motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesn’t want to so for our anniversary I said “pick which ID you want, I’ll drive you there, pay for it, and it’ll be done. I’ll put all the planning into it. All good” and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go, he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didn’t go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said “I’ll do it next week on my day off” so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while he’s not good at planning, I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not, as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test, I told him that I didn’t care if we went but if he wanted to study more, now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said “you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you” he just said “fair”. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what I’m wanting more of or how I’m hurt by something, he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or he’ll just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour let’s say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start, half hour mark, and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits, listens, and answers me with respect. The other times it’s that I have said even one word to set him off and he’s miserable. And angry and not nice. I’m finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what I’m showing him, all is good. If he doesn’t, he gets angry. Says he’s confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks that’s dumb or “why would someone even do that. They’re not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that”. If I’m talking about my work or just complaining, he’ll tell me why he doesn’t want to hear it. That it’s not part of his world so it doesn’t matter. I’ve asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do he’ll tell me something he needs in return. He can’t just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally can’t. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and he’s at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone, and I walk to another room, he says he feels guilty that I’m going away. And that he’ll just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesn’t get his way anyway. \n",

I don’t know for sure if I have avpd but I think I do I can’t pay for therapy I live with my mom and I hate her I’m 18 can’t drive alone I always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes I speed because I’m mad at my uncle. I have a job but I dropped out of school because I don’t care and I have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. And anyway nothing matters now except being famous that’s all I want I just have no idea why in real life I avoid people but online I have a girlfriend and I’m obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because I can’t stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me I don’t think I could take it I’ve only met her once in real life but it doesn’t matter I talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and she’s obsessed with me so I need her. I think I deserve to be famous more than anyone else because I’ve been through so much and also I feel like I’m better than most people something about me is different and I’m special . Can someone dm me to talk more about this? I need to know why I want to be famous and how can I get famous? Also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?\n",

Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who aren’t like that and find it weird. It’s almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because that’s what you need for a “happy life” (apparently) but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure there’s literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess I’m deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and can’t relate to others and feel insecure about it, like I wish I could be in the standard of what’s normal but I’m also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy 😭 it’s hard to put into words how I feel but it’s like I’m so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people don’t live their lives like that. I don’t want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isn’t normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad.

I see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money. It’s frustrating me to my core as I can never get an easy job like them as I can’t handle social interaction or talking. I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with “Requires excellent communication skills” or “Verbal communication required.” Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word, I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity. I even considered being a police officer for a while until I realized that you needed communication for that too. I’m more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders.

My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. (We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I can’t quite think of an example of that at the moment) he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it, he tells me it’s wrong. Example, he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options, drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago, he said he needed photo ID for a test at work he’d been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we don’t motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesn’t want to so for our anniversary I said “pick which ID you want, I’ll drive you there, pay for it, and it’ll be done. I’ll put all the planning into it. All good” and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go, he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didn’t go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said “I’ll do it next week on my day off” so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while he’s not good at planning, I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not, as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test, I told him that I didn’t care if we went but if he wanted to study more, now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said “you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you” he just said “fair”. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what I’m wanting more of or how I’m hurt by something, he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or he’ll just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour let’s say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start, half hour mark, and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits, listens, and answers me with respect. The other times it’s that I have said even one word to set him off and he’s miserable. And angry and not nice. I’m finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what I’m showing him, all is good. If he doesn’t, he gets angry. Says he’s confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks that’s dumb or “why would someone even do that. They’re not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that”. If I’m talking about my work or just complaining, he’ll tell me why he doesn’t want to hear it. That it’s not part of his world so it doesn’t matter. I’ve asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do he’ll tell me something he needs in return. He can’t just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally can’t. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and he’s at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone, and I walk to another room, he says he feels guilty that I’m going away. And that he’ll just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesn’t get his way anyway. \n",

            "I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).\n",

However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.\n",

In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem).

Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since.

After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I’ve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I’ve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can’t see it happening this time. I know it’s a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all I’d really appreciate it.\n",

It’s like disorienting. There are times it goes away but it’s definitely present mornings into afternoon. It feels unbearable to function and it’s not easy to distract yourself from.

            "Ilegible en: 52074 como: Something familiar started popping up in regards to work and it’s got me worried So back in 2017, I’” worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher as my first job. But after the busy season ended I was laid off. Not only that, but was basically laid off with no one even telling me since my boss at the time basically acted like I didn’t exist when I tried contacting them about potentially coming back. For roughly 5 years since, I basically jumped from one seasonal job to another. Then last year, I found myself being rehired in the same position, but this time the place is under new management. And honestly, I’ve loved it. Not only is a job I enjoy with a salary that is better than I would have initially expected, but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones. But since the start of the holiday season, I’ve been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in May. I’ve recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on Mother’s Day weekend, to which I responded roughly with “awesome. So I guess that will be roughly when I’m coming back?” That was 2 days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent. I’d assume it was cause everyone was busy and didn’t see, but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it. And now it’s starting to feel similar to when I got laid off when I first worked there. And I don’t know why I would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome I am for how hard I work and how good I am at my job. So, considering that, I may not have anything to worry about. But the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didn’t say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least. What should I do? Do I have reason to worry or am I just worrying too much about nothing?\n",

            "Ilegible en: 52076 como: Looking for perspective I (F18) have been given the diagnosis of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. I am in a constant state of fight or flight and I’ve never been in this much pain in my life. It’s the kind of pain people kill themselves from. I am constantly shaking and throwing up. This constant stress has given me the diagnosis of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I had to go to multiple doctors as IBS is hard to diagnose. The stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically I’m constantly in both mental and physical pain. However I believe it goes deeper than GAD. It doesn’t stop. It’s not attacks either it doesn’t come or go.. it stays. I’ve taken benzos and they don’t do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. I wish I could be sedated so I don’t have to be awake and in pain. There have been a few incidents where I had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. Luckily I found lamictal and it has saved my life. I honestly don’t think I would be alive today if it hadn’t been for modern medicine. But this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. I’m thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and I have to increase my dose every couple of weeks.

I don’t know what I can eat now. I’m so sick of food being like poison to me. I envy the people that can just eat and barely think about what it might be doing to their bodies.\n",

This was the first time I’ve done any drugs or anything like that not even weed but I wanted them from her and accepted them with a smile on my face being excited to do them.

I then cut off almost all contact with the girlfriend (thinking back I shouldn’t have done this and I do feel bad I was just so shaken up because of that experience) fast forward to now I am around lots of talk about drugs I always have but about 3 weeks ago when I was going to smoke my fiends cart for the first time, just talking about it gave me these tremors and I was shaking until I calmed down about 10 minutes later but I was talking to him with a smile on my face wanting to hit his cart I wasn’t scared at all I just got these shakes, these jitters in my legs I don’t even understand why their happening when I’m actually in front of or about to do drugs that don’t even scare me just on Wednesday I was going to buy some weed (regular flower) from my other friend and I got the same trembles just texting him and had to play it off with the people next to me saying I’m cold.

The anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people, going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore and I rarely get excited about things. I feel very emotionally numb to everything EXCEPT stress, fear, worry, and anger. My anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my SO. I feel like I care about nothing. I don’t find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends, doing the things I love or anything fun. My biggest problem and the main reason I’m making this post is that I don’t talk to ANYONE about it. I absolutely hate having to talk about how I feel and what I’m thinking, even if it’s not about anxiety.  All of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. I actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. I’m just tired of feeling numb, I’m tired of not having fun, I’m tired of this emptiness and I’m tired of feeling and thinking so many things I don’t understand. But this has been my entire life. It’s not an on and off thing. It’s how I think and how I feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life. Im scared that no amount of work, or therapy will fix it because I feel like I basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle.\n",

The other day, he made a comment about my rate of work, rhetorically asking “jokingly” why I can only do 1 of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time. Funnily enough he’s done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless. I get that I’m a slow worker and not the most skilled, but he makes it out as if I’m lazy and not bothered about my job… I am very much the opposite.

First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it’s something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn’t sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I’ve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..\n",

            "Since then I’ve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I’ve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I’d say it’s fair to diagnose as anxiety-related… though my therapist (I’m new to therapy since this all began) says he’s never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I’d say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I’m still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn’t thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.\n",

I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I’m busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it’s own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they’re not. It’s like being stuck in a dreaming state and it’s so scary and frustrating.

I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I’d have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it’s easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life.

I tried new things, I slowly came out of my shell.

I actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high 24/7 as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now. I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fear/ocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink. I am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because I am so afraid of the “high” feeling or derealization feeling but now don’t know where to go from here.

I was all for it, they’re family and I love em, but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. It also doesn’t help that I have absolutely nothing in common with any of them. All they talk about is work, their s/o’s and gossip. They said we would be sending each other memes but every meme they’ve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos I’ve ever seen. I don’t even know how to respond to them so so far I just haven’t. Now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and I feel like they’ve silently moved on. I just know it’s going back to the usual where I only ever talk to them at family gatherings, which is another awkward thing I’m going to stress about. I really am at a loss of how to handle myself, and I fear that if I eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups it’ll go the same way. I’ve tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past, but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds. I feel like by the time my brain is even able to process what was said and think of a response, they’ve already changed topics. Has anyone else here had to deal with this kind of thing before?\n",

On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. \n",

Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse.

A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, I talked to him about it a bit. I said “you can correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you don’t know how to respond or support me when I’m having really bad anxiety moments like this,” he said yeah that’s true, so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when I’m really struggling. He agreed, so I said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hug/holding me, taking a walk with me if that’s an available option, things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then, I’ve had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety.

The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit I’m think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but I’m a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0-100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didn’t my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like I’m tilting my head.

HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because I’m currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that it’s anxiety and it’s not high blood pressure (had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine) diabetes( I had general blood tests before and I didn’t have diabetes I am also a slim male 22) brain tumour ( head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago.

Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn’t talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am.

I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. \n",

I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it).

I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education.

            "So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life\" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.\n",

            "In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years).

And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.\n",

The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I’ve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I’ve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can’t see it happening this time.

I got on Prozac about 2 years ago and it’s helped tremendously. I get anxious here and there. I’ve gone to a whole bunch of doctors before the Prozac to all tell me I’m fine. Cardiologist, neurologist , ent etc. the other day I was at the pediatrician for my daughter and I started feeling somewhat antsy and hot and then I started sweating, feeling dizzy, felt short of breath, I thought I would pass out. I freaked out and didn’t calm down until I left about 30 mins later. I’m worried if I have a heart issue or if this just goes back to it being anxiety? I recently did bloodwork 3 weeks ago Everyrhing came out fine except my cholesterol being minor elevated which I’m taking care of already and eating super clean. Let me know what you guys think\n",

I thought that.... falling in love for the last time could help me. I thought this time it would be different, but it was not. I am so sad, quiet, lonely, and shy about it, I am empty, but now I see that... nothing good happens to me, I know that with all my heart since i was a kid, i knew it again today in my bones. yes, nothing good happens, i do not get better.. now i know. yesterday i was secretly so scared that my boyfriend might not like me anymore but today he did make it so true. i know I am nothin.. many facts abou it... in conclusion i do not deserve life: i was not the one bfore, i never going to be.

Hahahaha, have you told the world to only women?\",\n          \"Paradoxical cycle of my past, present and future and suicidal ideation Hi guys , \\n\\nSo I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.\\n\\nSo my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the WORST so far, I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. \\n\\nThinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.\\n\\nThese many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.\\n\\nI also have ADHD, social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends. Thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. So I've been asking if I am alone on this.
